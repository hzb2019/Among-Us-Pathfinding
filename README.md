# Among Us Pathfinding

This was the final project for our Fall 2021 CSE 331 Algorithms and Data Structures course.
It was to give us practice with Graph data structures and the implementation of their common functions.
This probably does not have much actual use for the game Among Us.

Final Score: 97/100
