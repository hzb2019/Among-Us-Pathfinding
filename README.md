# Among Us Pathfinding

This was the final project for our Fall 2021 CSE 331 Algorithms and Data Structures course.
It was to give us practice with Graph data structures and the implementation of their common functions.
This probably does not have much actual use for the game Among Us.

All project code can be found in Graph.py, tests can be found in tests.py, all tests pass as of Python 3.9.

Final Score: 97/100

Starter code was provided, credits for that go to the course staff.
